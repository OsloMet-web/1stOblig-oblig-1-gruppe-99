<p>In our MUF room (Music in depth), we had a lot of Mac PCs,
  each one with a MIDI keyboard for music production and composing.
  We also had only two toilets in the basement. One for males
  and one for females in the main building at Foss VGS (High school).</p>

  <p> I attended an adult High school program in Oslo. I had many different cultures among my classmates. It was a rich environment of different kinds of people, 
    each person of different ages. They were working hard to build a future for themselves and their families.
     </p>

  <p>This environment made it easy, fun and additionally motivating to work hard because I also dream of a better and more energetically sustainable lifestyle.</p>

I attended a high school in my home town. I choose to go was art and arcitecture, because regular studies were boring. 
My high school also had a educational offer where they focused on making food.
     
     </p>

  <p>

    Last Wednesday of every month they would sell what they had made and it made the entire school smell really nice.
